  <h1>What does a public administrator do?</h1>
  <p>A public administrator is a professional who is qualified to manage financial resources, technology, inputs, and people in state entities. 
 The main characteristic is obedience to the procedures provided by law. It is necessary to follow a procedure called bidding, which opens competition on an equal footing for all who wish to contribute to the public sector. Unlike the private administrator, the professional must have a deep knowledge of the law and know how to generate results within this more restricted scope of action.</p>
 <p>Public administration aims to work in favor of the public interest, and the rights and interests of the citizens it administers. Elsa is organized in such a way as to reduce bureaucratic processes.  In the case of indirect public administration, administrative decentralization is common, which means that some stakeholders can participate effectively in the management of services.</p>
 <p>Public administration in Brazil has gone through three phases: the patrimonialist phase (during the Empire era), the bureaucratic phase (during the Vargas era), and the managerial phase (the most recent phase that is being implemented).</p>

 <p>Many people take a competitive examination when they want to hold a position in the public administration.</p>

  <h3>Areas of activity
  </h3>
<p>The performance can occur in public agencies, municipalities, public foundations, among others.
</p> 

<h3>Public agencies</h3>
<p>  Public agencies are the internal divisions of municipalities, states, Federal District, and the Union. These units have specific attributions, such as looking after security, health, education etc. This is the case, for example, with government departments, schools, hospitals etc.</p>

<h3>Public Foundations</h3>
<p> Here, the public entity earmarks a quantity of assets and financial capital and, from these resources, creates an organization with a specific purpose. This is the case of the Fundação Biblioteca Nacional.</p>

<h3>What is the importance of Public Administration?</h3>
<p> Public Administration, as an activity, corresponds to the management of public services, development activities and police power. The first are services aimed at common needs; the second, incentive programs; and the third, activities that restrict freedom or property for the collective benefit.
 A model of the latter case are the inspection agencies. When the Civil Defense removes people from places with irregular construction, the restriction of property occurs, in order to serve security, which is a common good, for example.</p>
